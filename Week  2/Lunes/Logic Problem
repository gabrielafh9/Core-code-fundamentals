LOGIC PROBLEM

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday
Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday"
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday"
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday"
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday"
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesteday"

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

Alice says that nobody studied math yesterday, but if she's included in that it doesn't make sense, she's not gonna tell the teacher she didn't studied. 
Eva says 4 people studied mathematics yesterday, that's not real because only the ones who studied are telling the true, that statement contradicts the other students.
If Dan is telling the true he's contradicting his classmates and the same logic applies to Charlie.

Therefore, Bob is telling the truth because he's not contradicting anyone and he's the one who studied math.
