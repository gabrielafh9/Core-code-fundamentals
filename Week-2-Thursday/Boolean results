Algoritmo booleanValues
	a <- 5 == 3
	// a = false
	//Reason: if a is equal to 5 it's contradictory to say that a is equal to 3
	b <- 4 <> 3
	// b = true
	// Reason: we are comparing if 4 and 3 are different which is true
	c <- 7 > 7
	// c = false
	// Reason: We are comparing if 7 is grater than 7 which is false
	d <- 4 < 4
	// d = false
	// Reason: We are comparing if 4 is less than 4 which is false
	e <- 100 <= 90
	// e = false 
	//Reason: We are comparing if 100 is less  or equal to 90 which is false
	f <- 40 >= 40
	// f =  true
	// Reason: We are comparing if 40 is greater or equal than 40 which is true
